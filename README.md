# FactoryApp for Machines
## FactoryApp for Machines: Automated Monitoring and Task Management System

### Overview:
FactoryApp for Machines is an industrial application designed to monitor and manage machinery within a cooking oil factory. The app provides automated machine status updates, real-time performance tracking, and automated task scheduling to optimize machine usage and minimize downtime.

### Features:

1. **Automated Status Reporting:**
   Machines automatically report their operational status (running, idle, or under maintenance) using embedded sensors or IoT devices, enabling real-time monitoring for factory management.

2. **Performance Monitoring:**
   The app continuously tracks machine performance, including production rates, energy consumption, and operating conditions. This data is sent to a central dashboard for performance analysis and optimization.

3. **Automated Maintenance Alerts:**
   FactoryApp for Machines generates automatic maintenance notifications based on machine usage and operational data, ensuring timely maintenance to avoid breakdowns and increase the lifespan of machines.

4. **Task Scheduling:**
   Machines receive task instructions for production runs and report completion statuses back to the system. This automated workflow helps streamline factory operations and reduce manual intervention.

5. **Detailed Machine Specifications Logging:**
   The app stores detailed information about each machine, including brand, material type, thickness, capability, installation date, and maintenance history.

6. **Real-time Reporting:**
   Comprehensive reports, including machine status, performance, and task progress, are available in real time for decision-making.

7. **Failure Prediction and Risk Assessment:**
   The app analyzes operational data to predict potential failure points. It identifies which components are most at risk for breakdowns and estimates when those breakdowns are likely to occur.

### Technologies Used:

- **Android (Kotlin)** for mobile app development
- **Embedded Systems/IoT** for machine status and performance tracking.
- **Google Cloud IoT** Core for connecting and managing devices.
- **REST API** for communication with the backend system.
- **Node.js/Laravel** for backend services.
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** for database management.
- **Data visualization tools** for real-time reporting and analytics.

### Machine Specifications Tracked:

1. **Brand/Model:**  
   Each machine's make and model.

2. **Material:**  
   The type of metal used in the machine, such as stainless steel, carbon steel, or aluminum. This includes information on metal thickness.

3. **Capability:**
   Maximum load capacity, operational speed, and energy consumption.

4. **Installation Date:**  
   Exact date of installation.

5. **Maintenance and Repair History:**  
   All records of maintenance and repair, including the date of service, who performed the task, and the parts serviced or replaced.

6. **Potential Breakdown Areas:**
   The app identifies high-risk areas based on historical data and machine wear patterns.


### Reasons for Developing FactoryApp for Machines:

1. **Lack of Real-time Monitoring:**
   Monitoring machines manually is inefficient and time-consuming. FactoryApp for Machines automates this process, providing real-time data to management.

2. **Preventative Maintenance:**
   Without real-time data, maintenance is often reactive rather than proactive. FactoryApp for Machines ensures maintenance is done based on usage patterns, reducing downtime.

3. **Optimizing Machine Utilization:**
   Task assignments to machines are often handled manually, leading to inefficiencies. FactoryApp for Machines automates this, optimizing machine usage and production.

4. **Data-driven Performance Insights:**
   The lack of performance data makes it difficult to optimize machine settings. FactoryApp for Machines collects and analyzes this data for operational improvements.

5. **Lack of Detailed Machine Data:**
   Factory managers often lack granular data about machine specifications and performance, making maintenance planning difficult. FactoryApp for Machines logs all essential machine information, ensuring comprehensive oversight.

6. **Maintenance Planning Challenges:**
   Without automated tracking, it is hard to predict when and where maintenance is required. FactoryApp for Machines provides predictive insights based on operational data.

7. **Breakdown Prevention:**
   Manual checks cannot always catch issues before they become severe. FactoryApp for Machines uses predictive algorithms to warn of potential breakdowns, allowing preventive action.


### Goals of Developing FactoryApp for Machines:

1. **Maximize Machine Efficiency:**
   By automating task scheduling and maintenance alerts, the app helps increase the operational efficiency of machines and reduce idle time.

2. **Enhance Production Through Automation:**
   FactoryApp for Machines ensures seamless task assignment to machines, enhancing production flow without manual intervention.

3. **Reduce Downtime with Proactive Maintenance:**
   The app helps prevent machine breakdowns by sending proactive maintenance alerts based on real-time operational data.

4. **Data-driven Decision Making:**
   FactoryApp for Machines provides real-time analytics and reporting, enabling factory management to make informed decisions based on machine performance and production data.

5. **Optimize Resource Allocation:**
   By monitoring energy consumption and task performance, FactoryApp for Machines enables management to optimize resource usage, reducing operational costs.

6. **Maximize Uptime and Efficiency:**
   FactoryApp for Machines aims to reduce downtime and ensure that machines operate at optimal efficiency by automating maintenance scheduling and task management.

7. **Provide Comprehensive Machine Data:**
   The app provides a detailed log of machine specifications, usage history, and maintenance records, enabling better management and long-term planning.

8. **Proactive Maintenance Management:**
   FactoryApp for Machines reduces the risk of machine failures through predictive maintenance alerts, ensuring issues are resolved before they cause downtime.

9. **Failure Prediction and Prevention:**
   By monitoring wear patterns and analyzing historical data, the app predicts where and when breakdowns are likely to occur, helping factories prevent costly repairs.
